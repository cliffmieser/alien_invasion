# alien_invasion

This is the beginning of my alien invasion project!

After cloning the repo run the file "alien_invasion.py" to start the game.
Players can control the ship using the left and right arrow keys, and shoot bullets from the ship using the space bar.
If an alien reaches the end of the screen and collides with the ship, the player loses a life.
The game ends when the player loses all lives.
